Single paragraph which explains the feature.

# Motivation

# Guide-level explanation

Imagine the proposal is part of the language and you're explaining it for other Ham users.

- Explain newly introduced terms and concepts.
- Give a full fledged example usage.
- How does this change the way the user will write Ham in general.
- Does this affect current users, if yes, how does it inform the users to adjust to the change.

For implementation-oriented RFCs (e.g. for compiler internals), this section should focus on how compiler contributors should think about the change, and give examples of its concrete impact. For policy RFCs, this section should provide an example-driven introduction to the policy, and explain its impact in concrete terms.
